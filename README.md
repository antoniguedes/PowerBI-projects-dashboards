# PowerBI Projects Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my PowerBI Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of PowerBI projects, dashboards, and reports I've built to demonstrate data visualization, analytics, POwerQuery DAX and domain BI skills.

## üìä About

This repository serves as a centralized place for all my PowerBI work. Each project highlights different techniques, data sources, business domains, and visualization styles.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
The BI projects currently in the folder are:
- Sales analytics for an online bike e-commerce: the goal of this project was to highlight some of my PowerBI dashboard skills with bar charts and line charts as well as PowerQuery skills with DAX calculations and adding Date hierarchy to make the graphs per year, per month, as well as the dashboard with interactive filters by Year, by Month
-  Results of a study of Social Media usage and impact on Students perofrmance: here the goal was to make the chart as interactive as possible with many filters by age, gender, adiction score, because the dataset is not  huge, but the dimensions are multiple
