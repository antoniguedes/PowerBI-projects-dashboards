# üìä Dashboard Project ‚Äì Manufacturing Plant Sales & Gross Profit Analysis

**Project Overview**  
This dashboard presents [short description: e.g. ‚Äúan interactive performance overview of sales across regions over time‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomer support tickets by issue type and resolution times‚Äù, etc.]. The goal is to [what the dashboard helps with: decision-making, spotting trends, identifying bottlenecks, etc.].
**Project Title:** Manufacturing Plant Sales & Gross Profit analyis
**Theme:** Sales Performance Dashboard
**Objective:** To create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into sales data, with YTD and PYTD explicit measures and time comparaison, switches and conditional formating.

## üöÄ Main Steps & Skills Demonstrated

Here are the key steps in building this dashboard, along with the skills you‚Äôll see in action:

| Step | Description | Skills Used |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Data Collection & Import** | Acquire data from [source(s) ‚Äî e.g. CSVs, database, API] | Data import, working with file formats, basic ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) |
| **2. Data Cleaning & Transformation** | Clean missing values, filter irrelevant data, standardize formats (dates, categories, etc.) | Pandas / Power Query / SQL, handling missing data, normalization, data types |
| **3. Data Modeling / Aggregation** | Aggregate data into useful metrics (totals, averages, rates), possibly calculating derived fields | GroupBy operations, calculated fields, handling hierarchies/time series |
| **4. Visualization Design** | Build charts/tables/maps to show trends, comparisons, highlight key metrics | Data viz library or tool (e.g. Matplotlib / Seaborn / Power BI / Tableau), choosing chart types, designing layout |
| **5. Interactivity & Filters** | Add interactivity: filters by category/date, tooltips, drill-downs | Dashboard tool skills (filtering/slicing/dicing), user experience design |
| **6. Validation & Testing** | Verify correctness of numbers, test edge cases, double check labels, test performance on large data | Data validation, Python or notebook checks, sanity-checking results |
| **7. Presentation & Export** | Polish design, add titles/legends, export or share the dashboard | UI polish, storytelling, sharing/exporting (PDF, web, embedded) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Dashboard Creation

### 1. **Data Import and Data Transformation in PowerQUery**

**Description:**
Importing data from various sources and preparing it for analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Connecting to data sources (e.g., Excel, SQL Server)
* Data transformation using Power Query
* Handling missing values and data types
* Dates Columns format to Date, not Text.
* Remove Duplicates on the Primary Key
* Build the initial Data Model
* Rename the FACT Table and Dimensional Tables

### 2. **Creating Explicit Measures with DAX and Virtual Tables in PowerQuery**

**Description:**
Developing custom measures to calculate key metrics.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Creating calculated columns and measures
* Understanding row context and filter context
After cleaning the data, first we created virtual tables for different goals:  
* a Date Dimensional Table to have a Date Hierarchy
* a Data Table to have a Slicer to select between different KPIs: Sales, Gross Profits, Quantity
* a Measure Table to hold all the Measures created specifically for the Explicit Measures  
  
After, we create Explicit Measures in DAX that will be the back-bone of the interactivity of this dashboard :
* Creating Totals with DAX formulas
Quantity = SUM(Fact_Sales(quantity))  
Sales = SUM(Fact_Sales(sales_USD))  
COGs = SUM(Fact_Sales(COGS_USD))  
Gross Profit = [Sales]-[COGS]  
* YTD cumulative measures
* PYTD cumulative measures
* YTD-PYTD
PYTD_Sales = CALCULATE([Sales],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Date[Date]),Dim_Date[Inpast]=TRUE)  
PYTD_Quantity same formula  
PYTD_Gross_Profit same formula  
PYTD_Quantity = CALCULATE([Quantity],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Date[Date]),Dim_Date[Inpast]=TRUE)  
YTD_Sales = TOTALYTD([Sales],FACT_Sales[Date_Time])  
YTD_Gross Profit = TOTALYTD([Gross Profit],FACT_Sales[Date_Time])  
YTD_Quantity

### 3. **Building Relationships**

**Description:**
Establishing relationships between tables to enable seamless data analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Defining one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
* Managing relationship cardinality
* Utilizing star schema design

**Description:**
Creating various visual elements to represent data effectively.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Using different visualization types (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, KPIs)
* Formatting visuals for clarity
* Implementing slicers and filters

* Setting up bookmarks and buttons
* Configuring dynamic titles and measures
* Create SWITCHES as New Measures with DAX logic
- Switch 1 to PYTD values
- Switch 2 to YTD values
